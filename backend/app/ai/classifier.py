"""Material classification service.

The interface is what matters: `classify(image_bytes, hint) -> Prediction`.
Swap `ACTIVE_CLASSIFIER` for a TensorFlow/PyTorch implementation of
`BaseClassifier` and nothing else in the app changes.

This is NOT a trained model. It is an explainable heuristic over the simple
image statistics in `features.py`, and it is built around one honest idea:

    it is far more useful to say "that isn't e-waste" than to confidently
    mislabel a photograph.

v1 mapped "green-dominant image" straight to PCB, so a leaf or a flower came
back as a circuit board at 91% confidence. v2 runs a rejection stage first —
foliage, petals, sky and skin are recognised and refused — and then only
proposes a category when the picture actually looks like manufactured scrap
(hard edges, low saturation). When it is unsure it says so and asks the
collector to choose, instead of inventing a number.
