/**
 * Which camera mechanism to use for "Take Photo".
 *
 * Preference order, per the problem statement and because it is what works
 * best on entry-level Android:
 *
 *   1. Native capture — <input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="environment">.
 *      Hands off to the phone's own camera app. No library, no getUserMedia
 *      permission dance, no live-stream battery cost, and it works on old
 *      WebViews and over plain http on a LAN IP.
 *   2. In-app preview (getUserMedia) — only where native capture would just
 *      open a file dialog, i.e. desktop browsers with no camera intent.
 *
 * Both paths hand back the same JPEG data URL and feed the same pipeline.

/**
 * Which mechanism should "Take Photo" use?
 *
 *   'live'   — in-app getUserMedia preview with a shutter button.
 *   'native' — hand off to the device camera app via <input capture>.
 *
 * Live wins whenever it is actually usable, because it is the only option
 * that visibly opens a camera on a laptop. The previous rule keyed off touch
 * support alone, so a touchscreen Windows laptop took the native path and
 * "Take Photo" just opened the same file dialog as "Choose from gallery" —
 * which is exactly the bug this fixes.
 *
 * getUserMedia needs a secure context (https, or localhost). Over a LAN IP on
 * plain http it is unavailable, so a phone there correctly falls back to the
 * native camera app, which still works.
