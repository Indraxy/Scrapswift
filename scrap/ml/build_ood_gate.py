"""Build the out-of-distribution gate for the image classifier.

THE PROBLEM
    The classifier has ten classes and no "not e-waste" class, so softmax
    always names one of them. A photo of food came back as PCB at 0.81 and a
    household object at 0.98 — high confidence means "closest of the ten",
    NOT "this is e-waste". Confidence alone can never catch this.

THE GATE
    Project the image into the model's own PCA space and measure the mean
    distance to its k nearest TRAINING images. Anything the model has never
    seen anything like lands far away, whatever its softmax says. The
    threshold is calibrated on the validation split — a percentile of genuine
    in-distribution distances — so it is derived from data, not guessed.

    Raising the percentile rejects fewer real items and lets more junk in;
    lowering it does the opposite. The value used is printed and stored.
