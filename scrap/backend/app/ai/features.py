"""Image features for the prototype classifier.

Deliberately simple, explainable statistics — no trained weights. The point is
that every number here can be printed, argued with, and reproduced, which is
what makes the "is this even e-waste?" rejection defensible.

Features computed on a 96x96 downscale:

  edge_density        mean Sobel gradient magnitude, 0..1. Circuit boards,
                      cables and connectors are full of small high-contrast
                      detail; leaves, petals, sky and skin are smooth.
  strong_edge_frac    fraction of pixels above a high gradient threshold.
  saturation_mean     mean HSV saturation. Manufactured e-waste is mostly
                      desaturated (grey, black, dull green); flowers and
                      foliage are vividly saturated.
  vegetation_frac     pixels in the leaf/plant hue band with real saturation.
  petal_frac          pixels in vivid warm/magenta hues typical of flowers.
  sky_frac            bright, moderately saturated blue.
  skin_frac           narrow warm hue band with the R>G>B ordering of skin.
  value_mean/std      brightness statistics.
  grey_frac           near-neutral pixels (metal, plastic housings, tracks).
