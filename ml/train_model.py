"""Train and honestly evaluate the Smart Scrap Value Estimator.

Compares RandomForestRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor, keeps the
better one, and writes ml/scrap_price_model.pkl + ml/model_metrics.json.

THREE THINGS THIS SCRIPT REFUSES TO HIDE
  1. `base_reference_price` is NOT given to the model. It is the number the
     synthetic price was generated from, so including it would leak the
     answer and produce a meaningless R^2 near 1.0.
  2. The headline metrics are measured on SYNTHETIC data. They show the
     regressor recovered the generator's rules. They are NOT evidence of
     real-world price accuracy, and the JSON says so in `interpretation`.
  3. An unseen-material check is run deliberately: the model is asked to
     price materials it never saw in training. It does badly. That is the
     honest demonstration that this is a reference-anchored estimator, not a
     general market model.
